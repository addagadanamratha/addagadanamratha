# Hi, I'm Addagada Namratha!👩🏻‍💻

I'm a Computer Science graduate with a strong interest in **Data Science** and **Machine Learning**.  
I’m constantly exploring how data can be used to solve problems, tell stories, and drive decisions.  
With a background in **Big Data Analytics** and hands-on experience from academic projects and internships, I'm building my foundation one project at a time.

## 🧪 Projects from My Undergrad

Here are some of the key academic and hands-on projects I’ve worked on:
1. **🔍 Decoding Instructor Performance with ML & Data Mining**
   - Evaluated instructor performance across three datasets using ML models, achieving 90.15% accuracy. Deployed a web app to visualize insights and model predictions.
2. **🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction using ML Models**  
   - Built predictive models using Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, and KNN on a dataset of 5,110 individuals. Achieved 95.76% accuracy with KNN for early stroke detection applications.
3. **🛒 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering**  
   - Applied K-Means to segment retail customers, achieving a silhouette score of 0.5539. Helped drive targeted marketing through data-informed clusters.
4. **🏦 Bank Customer Loyalty & Segmentation (Hadoop, Hive, R)**  
   - Analyzed customer churn and segmentation patterns using Hadoop and Hive. Generated actionable insights to improve customer engagement and loyalty strategies.
5. **⚙️ Software Quality Attribute Quantification**  
   - Modeled and analyzed reliability in control systems using Petri nets and Time-Net. Focused on DFWCS, achieving a reliability percentage of 92%, supporting nuclear plant software evaluations.
6. **🏨 Hotel Booking Management System**
   - Developed a hotel management system with room booking, modifications, and cancellation features. Included robust admin tools for smooth operational control and user management.
7. **🚉 Online Railway Reservation System – Case Study**  
   - A systems-level design and evaluation case study
